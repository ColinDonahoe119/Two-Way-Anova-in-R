# Two-Way-Anova-in-R

A two way anova is a statistical test which determines if two categorical variables have an effect on a numerical variable. In this case, I used a 50 person dataset which includes Gender, Major (Accounting, Business Intelligence, and Marketing), and Salary. With a relatively small dataset, we cannot make broad and definitive conclusions based on the results, but this code demonstrates the utility in the Two Way Anova, and offers insights. 

Based on the results, Gender and major both have an impact on Salary, and there is an interaction effect between them. In fact, the p-value was just .00029, therefore we can reject the null hypothesis that there exists no Interaction effect. We see this as the mean salary among Accounting and Marketing majors are higher for women, but men have a higher mean salary in Business Intelligence.
